This is the first blogpost on this site with a new setup. I decided to try Github Pages with Jekyll. After following the [Github Pages Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages), I was able to have the setup up and running quickly. Time will tell whether this is a good decision, but so far, it feels very good, succinct, fast and convenient.

Will have to learn lots still of course–next step is customising the theme and take further control over the look and feel …
